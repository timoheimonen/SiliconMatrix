// 
// Parameters:

/*
 * _matrix_multiply_int64_asm:
 * This function performs matrix multiplication for 64-bit integer matrices.
 * 
 * Arguments:
 * - x0 (A): Pointer to the first input matrix (A).
 * - x1 (B): Pointer to the second input matrix (B).
 * - x2 (C): Pointer to the output matrix (C).
 * - w3 (N): Dimension of the square matrices (N x N).
 * 
 * Functionality:
 * - Sets up the stack and saves callee-saved registers.
 * - Moves input arguments into callee-saved registers for further use.
 * - Computes the row stride (N * 8) for efficient addressing of 64-bit integers.
 * - Checks if the matrix size (N) is greater than 200:
 *   - If true, branches to a path optimized for large matrices.
 *   - If false, proceeds with a simple i-k-j loop order optimized for small matrices.
 * - For small matrices, skips the initialization of the output matrix (C) and directly computes values in the inner loop.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - The function is optimized for small matrices by avoiding unnecessary zeroing of the output matrix.
 * - The i-k-j loop order is chosen for its efficiency in small matrix multiplication scenarios.

// Inner Loop Initialization:
// - Initializes the column counter (j) to 0 (stored in x24).
// - Checks if at least 4 columns can be processed at once by adding 3 to the column counter (j+3) and comparing it with N.

inner_loop_k_unroll2:
    This loop performs matrix multiplication for two columns of the result matrix (C) at a time,
    iterating over the shared dimension (k) of the input matrices (A and B). The loop is unrolled
    to process two columns (j and j+1) simultaneously for optimization.

    - Registers:
        x9: Base address of matrix A.
        x20: Base address of matrix B.
        x11: Base address of matrix C.
        x25: Current index k in the shared dimension.
        x24: Current column index j in matrix C.
        x22: Total number of columns in matrix C (N).
        x27: Number of columns in matrix B (N).
        x13, x14, x15: Temporary registers for address calculations.
        x0: Current element A[i][k].
        x2, x3: Current elements B[k][j] and B[k][j+1].
        x4, x5: Accumulators for C[i][j] and C[i][j+1].

    - Steps:
        1. Calculate the address of A[i][k] and load its value into x0.
        2. Calculate the base address of B[k][0] and then the addresses of B[k][j] and B[k][j+1].
        3. Load the values of B[k][j] and B[k][j+1] into x2 and x3.
        4. Perform multiply-accumulate operations to update the accumulators x4 and x5:
           - C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
           - C[i][j+1] += A[i][k] * B[k][j+1]
        5. Increment k and check if the loop should continue.
        6. After the loop, store the accumulated results (x4 and x5) back to C[i][j] and C[i][j+1].
        7. Increment j by 2 to process the next pair of columns.
        8. Check if there are more columns to process; if so, repeat the loop.
        9. Handle any remaining single column if the total number of columns is odd.

    - Notes:
        - The loop is optimized for performance by unrolling to process two columns at a time.
        - The use of ldp and stp instructions reduces memory access overhead.
        - The madd instruction combines multiplication and addition in a single step for efficiency.

      Adds the base address of row i in matrix C (x10) to the offset for column j (x24 shifted left by 3 to account for 64-bit integers).
      The result is stored in x11, which points to the memory location of C[i][j].

      Sets x4 to zero (xzr) to initialize the accumulator for the dot product of row i of matrix A and column j of matrix B.

    - Process one column through all k values
      Sets x25 to zero (xzr) to initialize the loop counter k, which iterates through the elements of the row and column being multiplied.

/*
 * inner_loop_k_single:
 * This function performs the inner loop of a matrix multiplication operation for a single element of the result matrix C[i][j].
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Calculate the address of A[i][k] and load its value into x0.
 * 2. Compute the address of B[k][j] using the base address of B and load its value into x2.
 * 3. Perform the multiply-accumulate operation: C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j].
 * 4. Increment the loop counter k and check if it has reached the limit (x22). If not, repeat the loop.
 * 5. Once the loop is complete, store the computed value of C[i][j] into memory.
 * 6. Increment the loop counter j and check if it has reached the limit (x22). If not, jump to the outer loop (inner_loop_j_single).
 * 
 * Registers used:
 * - x9: Base address of matrix A.
 * - x20: Base address of matrix B.
 * - x11: Address to store the result in matrix C.
 * - x25: Loop counter for k.
 * - x24: Loop counter for j.
 * - x22: Limit for loop counters (N).
 * - x27: Scaling factor for matrix B (N * 8).
 * - x4: Accumulator for the result of C[i][j].
 * - x0: Temporary register to hold A[i][k].
 * - x2: Temporary register to hold B[k][j].
 * - x13, x14, x15: Temporary registers for address calculations.
